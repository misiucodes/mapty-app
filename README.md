## Built With
* JavaScript (structured using OOP)
* HTML
* CSS
* Leaflet library (for live map)
* Local Storage API

## Features
The UI can be manipulated from the user by:
* Editing workouts
* Deleting workouts
* Resetting the app 
* Navigating the map on the corresponding workout

Added user friendly modal window to display errors when API cannot retrieve user's location, when user does not enter valid input and when user tries to change uneditable fields.
